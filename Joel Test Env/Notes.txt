Notes:
	Use two separate dictionaries to store bid orders and ask orders
	Keep active order count for both bids and asks - 4 max on each side
	Etf threshold should be much higher than V_MAX
		Maybe 60-80
	Do not open new position until np.abs(net etf position) is less than desired threshold
		Remaining volume for active orders:
			Can either simultaneously reduce to 0
				Best scenario - simply open new orders on both sides if this happens
			Can both get stuck
				Ok scenario - simply cancel both others and open new orders on both sides if this happens
			One can reduce whereas the other gets stuck
				Bad scenario - need to use threshold to figure out when net etf position is breached. Start by cancelling first in orders on opposite side of
				net etf position and inserting new orders of FAK type - Ok to cross the spread, use etf prices
	If cancelling too many orders --> not inserting orders that are good enough
		Being able to open too many orders combined with this risks message limit breach
	Cannot rely on FAK order types to dump position  because dependent on other bots to have open positions (e.g. example2 with 1 lot on each side --> will end up
	stacking order requests rather than dumping position)
